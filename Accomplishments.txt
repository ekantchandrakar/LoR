Microservices Orchestration & BFF: Engineered a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Orchestration service from scratch using Spring Boot; implemented logic to aggregate and synchronize responses from three downstream microservices, reducing frontend latency and improving data consistency.

Event-Driven System Design: Architected a high-throughput Pub/Sub event-driven system to automate Vehicle Recall Targeting event.

Cloud Observability & Automation: Designed a robust Observability Framework utilizing Micrometer for distributed tracing and Dynatrace SaaS for performance monitoring; developed automated incident response systems using Cloud Functions and Pub/Sub to trigger ServiceNow APIs based on real-time log analysis.

API Architecture & Migration: Managed the large-scale migration of legacy APIs to a modern APIGEE architecture; coordinated technical integration and compatibility testing for 30+ downstream consumer applications to ensure zero-downtime transition.

Full-Stack Integration: Led the integration of cloud-based Microfrontend (MFE) architectures into central service hubs, ensuring seamless integration of independent cloud based frontend modules.

System Modernization: Facilitated the migration of core services to Spring Boot 3.0, leveraging the latest JVM enhancements and Jakarta EE dependencies to improve system security and runtime performance.

Working on GCP services like Cloud Run, Cloud Funtions, PubSub, BigQuery, GCS etc. with terraform.
